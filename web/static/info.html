    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Welcome! Plurabus is a 2D head-to-head multiplayer game played on a 100x100 board. The screen is divided into the game board, the menu (on the bottom) and the information panel (on the right). This is what the game looks like when it starts.</p>

    <p>Those large checkered blocks are called Spawners. They continuously create the smaller blocks, called Agents. When the game begins you are assigned one of the two colors as your team. The other color is your opponent. Control the Agents on your team by placing tasks on the board for them to complete, called Objectives. The goal of the game is to be the first one to destroy your opponent's Spawner entirely.</p>
    <h4>Objectives</h4>
    <p>When you click and drag the mouse on the game board, it selects a rectangular region. Then, click on the triple bars icon in the menu to place an Objective.</p>
    <p>The Objectives that you can designate on a region are:
      <ul>
	<li>Wall - Build a wall on every empty unit in the region, which no Agents can pass through</li>
	<li>Door - Build a door on every wall unit in the region, which only your Agents can pass through</li>
	<li>Go To - Command your Agents to go to the region and stay there</li>
	<li>Attack - Attack all walls, doors, Buildings, and enemy Agents in the region</li>
      </ul>
      You can also create Buildings with your Agents, also by setting an Objective through the triple bars menu. The difference is that you don't need to select a region first - select the Building that you want to create and an outline will appear around the mouse. Click the mouse where you want the Building to be constructed and an Objective will be created in the outline. The types of Buildings you can create are:
      <ul>
	<li>Tower - Continuously destroys enemy Agents within a radius</li>
	<li>Subspawner - Continuously spawns friendly Agents, at a lower rate than your main Spawner</li>
	<li>Bomb - Once completed, detonates and destroys everything (both friendly and enemy) within a radius</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>An active objective will be highlighted in yellow. Click the objective and press the X in the menu to remove it.</p>
    <h4>Controls</h4>
    <p>There are also keybinds to do each of the commands in the triple bars menu. Once a region is selected, press:
      <ul>
	<li>W - Wall</li>
	<li>D - Door</li>
	<li>G - Go To</li>
	<li>A - Attack</li>
      </ul>
      At any time, press:
      <ul>
	<li>T - Tower</li>
	<li>S - Subspawner</li>
	<li>B - Bomb</li>
      </ul>
      Press Backspace to delete a selected objective. Right click to clear the current selection.</p>
